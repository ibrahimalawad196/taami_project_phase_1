## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes real data provided by **Taami (Food Preservation Charity)** to identify trends in food donations, understand the causes of food waste, and support better decision-making to enhance food management efficiency.

The primary goal of this project is to convert raw data from the charity into actionable insights to:
- Reduce food waste.
- Identify key donors with the highest rates of valid and invalid meals.
- Highlight days with unusual food waste patterns.
- Support the charity’s operational planning and decision-making.

This project is part of my data analysis learning journey and applies analytical skills to support social impact initiatives.
